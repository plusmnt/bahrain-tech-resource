## Known issues
### NTP Protocal (STC network)
For some reason [NTP protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc958) blocked by STC network, if you are trying to get the time from the internet you can use [HTTP Time protocol](http://www.vervest.org/htp/) instead.      

To test if your ISP block NTP you can install [Python NTP library](https://pypi.org/project/ntplib/) and run the example. If you get `NTPException: No response received from europe.pool.ntp.org.` exception, your ISP is blocking  NTP connection.

### STC timeout redirect error.
If you try to connect to offline server or unregistered domain you will get a [302 http](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/302) code and get redirected to https://stcerror.stc.com.bh/.     
The solution to this problem is to change your DNS to someone else other than STC DNS, if your service check if the domain is working, you might need to check if you get redirected to `stcerror.stc.com.bh` and consider that as timeout error.
